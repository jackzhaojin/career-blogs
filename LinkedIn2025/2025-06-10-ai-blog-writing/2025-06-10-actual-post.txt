✍️ How I Use AI for Writing Articles (Without Falling Into the Slop Trap)

TLDR: The raw original thoughts you feed the AI should be twice as long as the final blog.

🎯 The Right Way

📝 Collect & Marinate First: I spend weeks gathering thoughts offline. Every conversation, article, or shower thought gets noted down. Note down your stories and unique experiences. Notes don't have to be coherent - sometimes single sentences, sometimes voice-to-text paragraphs. This is the most important part.

🎤 Let AI Interview You: Instead of asking AI to "write about X," have it interview you about your collected thoughts. This extracts deeper insights and keeps the output authentically you. I do this with voice chat. By this point, my input is already 2x the final blog length.

🌊 Own Your Narrative Flow: I structure the story. AI doesn't know what journey I want to take readers on.

🧬 Create Your Content DNA: I maintain a blog specification with my voice, style, and past posts to emulate. This gives AI guardrails to work within my brand, not replace it.

🔄 Version Control Everything: Using markdown and git, I trace edits paragraph by paragraph. I see AI as a contributor to my codebase, not the other way around. I'm the maintainer, AI is the contributor.

💩 The Wrong Way (AI Slop)

🚫 Zero Research: "Write a 2000-word blog about [topic]" with no domain knowledge, personal experience, or unique angle.

🤖 Generic Prompting: Asking AI broad questions that could apply to anyone, anywhere. No personal insights, no specific context.

🗌 Copy-Paste Publishing: Taking AI output as-is without adding personal narrative, examples, or perspective.

👻 No Voice Guidelines: Every piece sounds like the same corporate-speak because there's no personality or brand consistency.

⚫ Black Box Process: No understanding of what AI contributed vs. original thought. No iteration, no refinement.

💡 Think of AI like a really smart junior editor on your team.

🧠 They help structure thoughts, suggest improvements, and catch what you missed. But they can't replace your domain expertise, unique perspective, or creative vision.

✨ The content that resonates could only have been written by you. AI is your collaborative partner, not your ghostwriter.
