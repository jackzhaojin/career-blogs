Break this in multiple paragraphs. All of these options will not make it to any one single sales side I would imagine from Adobe or any consulting firm. Capturing opportunities is about story telling and narrative building. This slide will distract and confuse. If Adobe had a workshop and decided EDS, service providers will bring EDS stories. If long time consulting team decided on headless CMS, headless CMS will be the focus of story telling from Adobe.

At best consulting firms has the breathe to bring the best solution to the client, leaner Adobe consulting partners may have to bring what they know or they have staffing for.

To me the big picture of all Adobe offering is lost in the process. However seeing this helps my technical brain and hopefully itâ€™ll help you as well
