### üí° When to Use Universal Editor

UE is less feature-rich than Sites Editor (no editable templates, weaker dialog support), but it's preferable in the following scenarios:

* **Headless/Hybrid Architectures**: React/Next.js frontends consuming content via APIs.
* **Edge Delivery Services**: Optimized for stateless, fast-delivery HTML sites.
* **Multi-channel Reuse**: Content fragments reused across web, mobile, and kiosk.
* **Developer-controlled Frontends**: Rendering logic lives outside AEM (e.g., external JS apps).

---

### üîÑ Why Traditional Sites Editor May Be Preferred

Use Sites Editor when:

* You want drag-and-drop layout control.
* You use editable templates and policies.
* You're building headful AEM sites using HTL and Sling Models.
* You rely heavily on component dialogs and in-place authoring.

### ü§ù User Context Notes

* The user is a senior AEM architect familiar with Sites, EDS, and hybrid deployments.
* They‚Äôre comparing modern authoring strategies (UE vs Sites) for client use cases.
* They've noted that UE lacks editable templates and advanced dialogs.
* They are building both internal and client-facing narratives requiring Adobe alignment.
* They have live examples of Sites, Headless, and EDS-based deployments (e.g., newsroom.accenture.com).
