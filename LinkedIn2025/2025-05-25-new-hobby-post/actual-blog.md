# I Have a New Hobby, and It’s Coding With AI

## 1. Backdrop

Most of my career, especially over the past several years at Accenture, has been about **technical leadership**, thinking in systems, designing solutions, and communicating across time zones. I spend a lot of time creating **architecture diagrams**, documenting platform decisions, and aligning teams to execute complex builds the right way.

It’s a role that requires **clarity**, not keystrokes. I guide the build more than I do the building. And I’ve come to enjoy that. That clarity means the client knows what they’re getting, **the esteemed teammates across the ocean** know exactly what they’re building, and the documentation often acts as a knowledge transfer artifact long after the project is complete.

So when I started experimenting with AI tools at first, it wasn’t because I was looking to go back to hands-on development full-time. It was because I was looking for ways to **do my job more efficiently**, stay close to the tech, and sharpen skills that are good for both my role and my curiosity.

Turns out, yes.

And now, weirdly enough, I have a new hobby.

## 2. Building as a Hobby with AI

I didn’t plan for this to happen. But once I started playing around with AI-assisted tools, something lit up. Building things suddenly felt **fast again**, **fun again**, **creative again**.

It reminded me of other hobbies people pick up later in life, woodworking, drawing, cooking. You don’t need to be great. You just need to **enjoy it**. For me, this was that. Only instead of sanding wood, I was deploying web apps on Azure with Claude and Copilot helping me out along the way.

One weekend I built a tool that turns written feedback into STAR stories. [Here’s the blog I wrote about that](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/vibe-coding-sunday-ranking-ai-tools-star-story-generation-jack-jin-cadnc). But honestly, the project wasn’t the point. The point was that I could build something **in a day that used to take me weeks**. That I could stay close to the tech my team uses, in a low-pressure, this is kinda cool way.

There’s something powerful about the **feedback loop AI gives you**. You think of something, test it, tweak it, and it works, or it doesn’t, but you learn fast. It’s satisfying. Addicting, even. Especially after years of being the person telling others how to build instead of doing it yourself.

The tools aren’t perfect. **Sometimes they make stuff up**. Sometimes I know what they’re doing, sometimes I don’t. But it doesn't matter. I’m not trying to be perfect, I’m just trying to create. **Sometimes I make stuff up too, based on my training and context window**. Although years of consulting and leadership taught me to buffer my confidence, even if I'm 98% sure of something.

## 3. What This Means for Me

Reflecting on my career, I’ve been a **senior manager and architect** for the past 5 years and I’m looking forward to gaining new skills to push my career forward. This is a **hobby** I hope I’ll keep.

It’s helped me reconnect with the tech. It’s made me **more confident** when I talk to my team about tools and platforms, not just because I’ve read about them, but because I’ve had the chance to explore them firsthand in a more hands-on way.
