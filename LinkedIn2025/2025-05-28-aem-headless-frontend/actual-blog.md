### **Why AEM Headless Makes Sense When Frontend Teams Lead the Way**

Before we dive in, this series of AEM blog posts will use fictitious language to obscure my current and past clients. Instead of saying "we did this x times", I'll choose to say "it's possible to do this". For additional client protection, maybe from time to time, I might be making things up, but this should be rare.

You‚Äôll notice this blog intentionally goes light on omni-channel headless strategy and AEM‚Äôs full headless capabilities. That‚Äôs by design. I‚Äôll explore those concepts in a future blog post.

### üìçPart 1: What the Situation Could Be

Imagine a scenario: a client has heavily invested in their **frontend stack**. Maybe it‚Äôs a sleek Next.js application, or maybe they‚Äôve fallen in love with Vue. Maybe they have a **tightly coupled** ERP or ecommerce system. The idea of switching all that out just to accommodate a CMS might feel like a non-starter. In many modern orgs, frontend is no longer just a layer; it‚Äôs the foundation.

Sometimes content comes second. If at all. **The UI must go live**, then content consideration follows.

When AEM is introduced as a headless CMS, some clients worry they‚Äôre stepping back in time, losing WYSIWYG, in-context editing, and the power authors once had. I‚Äôve seen this same cycle repeat across the last 18 years in content management. I‚Äôve been around that long. And I can confidently say: this time, it can be different.

Some frontend teams love **full ownership**. Moving from HTL components (a step up from JSPs, sure) to a fully decoupled frontend lets them finally own the entire experience, from layout to routing, animation to rendering.

### üõ† Part 2: The Approach That Works

A smart starting point is to **start together, and start small**. One approach: spin up a single page with just three components. Don‚Äôt boil the ocean. Build trust and shared vocabulary first. A working pattern. Learn together.

In a successful exploration, you‚Äôll often find daily (sometimes even **twice daily**) working sessions during the proof of concept phase. It‚Äôs not just sync, it's about shared problem-solving and walking through code and content structures together.

**GraphQL persisted queries** have emerged as a clear win for security and caching (GET over POST). But there's nuance: with 12 page templates and a library of 30+ components, you‚Äôll want to avoid repetitive query definitions. Sometimes folks are moving the logic.

**Internationalization** is also front and center. In AEMaaCS, structured content, language roots, and translation workflows help manage global scale. A truly headless model doesn‚Äôt mean ignoring localization. Translation workflows and projects are also very applicable here.

Personalization is another layer that integrates well here. It's possible to publish multiple content fragments into **Adobe Target** or other personalization platforms. In some cases, those fragments can be personalized based on persona segments mapped from **Adobe Experience Platform (AEP)** or other data sources. Although I would prefer the targetting capability to choose the content to show, and **avoid AEM persona tagging**, some times this is not practical, and that's ok. All this allows for scalable, dynamic experiences without tightly coupling the logic into the frontend.

Finally, **preview matters**. Enabling in-context preview in AEMaaCS helps reconnect authors to what they're publishing. Even in a decoupled setup. And with Adobe‚Äôs Universal Editor instrumentation, editors can see their edits reflected live in the experience.

### üöÄ Part 3: How Things Could Turn Out

In successful models, the frontend is already up and running. Universal Editor becomes an additive layer **rather than a blocker**. Strong frontend teams thrive here: they move fast, deliver rich experiences, and AEM just becomes the source of structured truth.

If the frontend leans into **server-side rendering** (e.g., Next.js in production mode with React Server Components), the performance story is incredibly strong. Think **fast load, prefetching**, and SEO-friendly markup with minimal compromise.

Would I recommend AEM headless to everyone? Not quite. It depends on your team setup. If you have a passionate frontend team deeply committed to their stack, or have a tightly coupled UI with another system, then **forcing classic AEM sites authoring might be the real architectural mistake**. Maybe even an architectural sin.
