💻 If you follow me on GitHub (https://github.com/jackzhaojin), you've probably noticed I've been keeping up with my new hobby - AI-assisted coding! You might see quite a dozen codex cloud based agent ai code merges. It's been an incredible learning journey since I wrote about it back in May: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-have-new-hobby-its-coding-ai-jack-jin/

I'm taking a break from writing LinkedIn articles. Going to take a family vacation and do more AI coding. I do have quite a few blog post planned (link to my blog post writing with AI) so stay tuned! I do have thoughts.
