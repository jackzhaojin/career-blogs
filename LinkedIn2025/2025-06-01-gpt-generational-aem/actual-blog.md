## Blog Title: From Bookshelves to Reasoning Tokens and Reflecting on Adobe's Marketing Cloud Evolution

*Exploring the evolution of thinking, tooling, and content systems through the lens of Adobe Experience Manager and generational shifts in knowledge access. This reflection is meant to explore how each generation worked with the tools they had, not to judge or stereotype by age. It is a celebration of adaptation, not a comparison of capability.*

### Part 1: Setting the Stage – From Encyclopedias to AI Voice

I still remember a time when finding answers meant flipping pages. Growing up, if I wanted to learn something, I had two options. I could ask someone or head to the library. Maybe watch Bill Nye the Science Guy. Then came Google. For my generation, that changed everything.

* I’m Google-native. I did grow up reading books for answers. In my high school and college years, I searched.
* Problem-solving became less about knowing the answer. It became more about knowing where to find it.
* Over time, I got really good at navigating search engines, forums, and documentation.

Now I’m watching my children grow up in a different world. The fastest way to solve a problem is not typing keywords. It is asking ChatGPT aloud.

I’ve started introducing them to AI tools like voice mode in ChatGPT. Not just to use them, but to rely on them. To think with them natively.

Let’s draw a parallel to the systems I work with:

* **Encyclopedia generation**: Local knowledge and physical ownership. Think of Adobe Experience Manager 6.5 and TarMK.
* **Google generation**: Searching replaces storage. Think of AEM as a Cloud Service and containerization.
* **AI-native generation**: Synthesis and reasoning at scale. Think of Adobe Experience Platform and Azure-native intelligence.

This is more than a technology evolution. It is a generational shift. It changes how we learn, how we build, and how we think.

### Part 2: What I’ve Lived Through and Learned

#### 2.1 – The Book Era: AEM 6.5, TarMK, and Physical Knowledge

Before Google, knowledge lived in books. Lawyers lined their walls with legal tomes. Doctors kept medical encyclopedias close. Your bookshelf was your power. In many professions, referencing physical material was a sign of rigor. Owning volumes meant you were serious. Solutions came from knowing which chapter, which book, and which page. If you didn’t have access to a library or the right set of books, you didn’t have access to the knowledge itself.

I spent over a decade working on Adobe Experience Manager 6.5. It reflected this way of thinking:

* Content repositories lived on the server. TarMK used a file-based model for vertical scaling. All data and binaries were physically stored on the local disk.
* There was no elasticity. Scaling meant routing traffic manually. You had to provision additional publish instances and set up dispatcher filters and load balancer rules to handle it.
* Architects needed deep Java skills. We had to understand OSGi, replication agents, dispatcher configs, and JVM tuning.
* We also needed Linux command line fluency. Understanding cron jobs, shell scripting, file permissions, and log analysis was part of the job.
* Network knowledge was essential. We had to map firewalls, troubleshoot IP routing between author and publish tiers, and ensure assets flowed correctly across replication paths.

AEM 6.5 systems were heavy but powerful. Everything was in-house. To scale, you added servers and tuned infrastructure. It was like having a legal bookshelf. You had to know how to navigate the system and manage every part of the stack yourself.

Emphasize the concept that without a physical library or server, there was no access to knowledge or content. Locality was everything—both for people and systems.

#### 2.2 – The Search Era: Googling, Stack Overflow, and AEMaaCS

Then came my era. The age of Google-native thinking.

I didn’t memorize everything. I learned how to search well. If I didn’t know the answer, I googled it. Stack Overflow, Medium, and Adobe forums were my reference tools. The better I got at searching, the more effective I became.

I have books on my bookshelf, but they're decor. Once upon a time they had a real purpose.

I transitioned to AEM as a Cloud Service in 2023. That felt late. But when I did, it was like floating after years of swimming with weights.

* Infrastructure became Adobe’s job. I stopped worrying about replication queues and segment stores.
* Service became Adobe's job as well, many folks understood that we deployed code to it, but it's an extension of the service Adobe provides.
* TarMK gave way to modern cloud storages. VMs gave way to containers. I didn’t need to manage the base system anymore.
* Deployments meant building an image with Adobe's code merged into my code.
* My role shifted. I moved from Java configurations to system design.

Knowledge wasn’t about what you remembered. It was about how quickly you found and applied it.

#### 2.3 – The AI-Native Era: Reasoning Tokens and the Next Generation

Now we are on the edge of a new era. One where my children will grow up.

&#x20;

Adobe Experience Platform is a true AI-native product. It is built on Azure. It offers real-time profiles and scalable orchestration. It is not just another cloud app. It offers capabilities that is only possible because it's cloud native. It wasn't because it's born in VMs, then made to containers, it's a cloud native product with very little traces of the capabilities and origins.

Just like my child might not be able to go to a library and find information as efficiently, AEP doesn't run on a person's local VM either. It's an evolution with trade offs.

My children won’t just use AI. They’ll think with it. They’ll synthesize data, debug ideas, and generate content with AI help.

* They won’t just search. They’ll collaborate.
* They’ll use reasoning tokens to refine their thinking.
* Their mistakes will trigger learning loops. Feedback will be instant.

Schools may not teach this yet. But I will. I’ll show them how to co-pilot with AI. How to question it. How to build with it. Because for them, this is their Google.

### Part 3: A Call to Action

AI is not the finish line. It is the next step. Book readers learned to use Google. I am learning to use AI. I don’t fear it. I don’t blindly trust it. I grow with it.

This is my moment to improve myself. It is also my opportunity to help my children grow. I see a tremendous opportunity for them.

Let’s stop judging those who try. Let’s start building. Try. Fail. Learn. Succeed. Then try again.

And if Gen AI turns out to be another blockchain or metaverse, I'll be wrong, and I have tried. I don't think I'm wrong here.

Here’s the quote that stayed with me. It was on the glass conference room wall at my first company to the right of the entrance. I didn’t understand it then. I do understand it more now.

> *"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."*
> — **Theodore Roosevelt, 1910**
