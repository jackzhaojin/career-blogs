## "How Adobe EDS Stacks Up Against the Modern Web"

### **Concept Theme:** Enterprise transformation and architectural evolution

## **Visual Elements:**

### 1. **Central Focus:** Split composition showing "old vs. new"
- **Left side:** Traditional monolithic CMS represented by heavy, interconnected server blocks/towers (darker colors, more complex)
- **Right side:** Modern edge architecture with lightweight, distributed nodes at global edge points (brighter, cleaner)

### 2. **Key Visual Metaphors:**
- **Speed/Edge concept:** Lightning bolts or speed lines radiating from edge nodes
- **Familiar authoring:** Small icons of Google Docs/Word floating above the edge side
- **Enterprise readiness:** Professional team silhouettes collaborating around the modern architecture

### 3. **Color Palette:**
- **Adobe brand colors:** Adobe red (#FF0000) as accent
- **Technology gradient:** Deep blue to bright cyan suggesting cloud/edge
- **Professional contrast:** Clean whites and subtle grays

### 4. **Typography Overlay:**
- Main headline: "How Adobe EDS Stacks Up Against the Modern Web" (bold, modern sans-serif)
- Subtext: "Enterprise-Ready Architecture" (lighter weight)

### 5. **Technical Details:**
- Subtle network connections showing global distribution
- Small "0ms" performance indicators near edge nodes
- Workflow arrows showing simplified publishing path (Docs → Edge → Global delivery)

## **Style Direction:**
- Clean, professional, enterprise-focused
- Modern tech aesthetic without being overly technical
- Balanced composition that works well in LinkedIn's feed format
- Scalable design that reads well at both large and thumbnail sizes

## **Key Message Visual:**
The image should immediately convey the transformation from complex, slow traditional systems to simple, fast, enterprise-ready edge delivery - emphasizing that this isn't just about speed, but about empowering business teams with familiar tools.

## **Article Context Notes:**
- **Main Theme:** Adobe EDS as a complete enterprise solution vs. fragmented alternatives
- **Key Differentiator:** Familiar authoring (Google Docs/Word) + enterprise workflows + edge performance
- **Target Audience:** Enterprise architects, CMS decision-makers, marketing technology leaders
- **Tone:** Professional, authoritative, forward-thinking

---

## **Competitive Landscape Visualization Ideas:**
Consider showing Adobe EDS as a unified platform compared to other solutions that require multiple tools/services:
- **Adobe EDS:** Single integrated circle/platform
- **Others:** Multiple disconnected pieces (Cloudflare + tools, Netlify + CMS, etc.)
