# The Edge CMS Shift: How Adobe EDS Stacks Up Against the Modern Web

*Before we dive in, this series of AEM blog posts will use fictitious language to protect my current and past clients.  I also support some our other projects as internal SMA for advisory. Instead of saying "we did this x times", I'll choose to say "it's possible to do this". This is for client protection.*

# Setting the Stage: Why the Enterprise Is Ready for Edge

There’s a clear shift happening in the way enterprise content is delivered. Traditional CMS platforms, once deeply embedded into **monolithic infrastructure, are being split apart**. Systems are going modular. Authoring is becoming more distributed. The frontend is decoupled, the backend is lean, and publishing needs to be instant.

Many organizations feel this tension. Marketing teams need to move faster. **Developers want to streamline their stacks**. Authors want fewer tools to learn. Docs are intuitive. Google Docs or Word already feel like home. The idea that those surfaces can power live websites is no longer science fiction. It’s architecture.

Adobe isn’t entering an overcrowded space this time. It’s introducing something new at the enterprise level. Edge Delivery Services (EDS) brings together static generation, content workflows, and edge rendering, **like no one else**. All wrapped into one system, good to go in less than 1 hour, and ready for enterprise scale.

# From CQ to EDS: A Platform Evolution

Back when Day entered the CMS space with CQ5, it wasn’t first. **but it was better**. Authoring stood out. Dispatcher came bundled. TarMK made deployment easier. Compared to Documentum and others, CQ offered a unified way to manage content that was both powerful and intuitive.

Then came AEM as a Cloud Service (AEMaaCS). A big step forward. Infrastructure became Adobe’s responsibility. Clients stopped worrying about replication queues and JVM tuning. It moved AEM into the containerized world. **But even so, many of the legacy assumptions stayed**. Authoring was still tied to Sites. Deployment pipelines still required dev ops overhead. Monoliths got smaller. But didn’t disappear.

Edge Delivery Services represents the next major leap. It's not an upgrade of AEM. It’s a reimagining. Fully cloud-native. **No backend code. No runtime errors**. No dispatcher. Just GitHub-hosted templates, Word or Google Docs for content, and a fast path to edge rendering. AEM content came later as a content repository but the same concept.

The model is foolproof by design. There’s nothing to compile. Nothing to break and give you a 500. Business teams use Docs. Developers define templates and blocks. Pages get rendered **at the edge** instantly. That means fast performance, easy collaboration, and zero cold starts.

Cloud platforms like Azure are increasingly the invisible backbone of modern websites. When paired with an edge-native delivery system like EDS, these cloud services shine. They’re not just hosting environments. They offer API orchestration, durable functions, and serverless compute. These are the tools of a modern cloud engineer, and they complement the EDS offering perfectly.

And Adobe is betting early. This isn’t a trend-following move. It’s a market-breaking one.

# EDS vs Other Offerings

It’s tempting to lump EDS into the same category as **static site generators** or edge-hosted frameworks. After all, the surface-level architecture, static HTML files, Git-based deployments, fast global delivery, all looks familiar. But that’s where the similarities end.

Most developer-first platforms focus on building fast websites, but they assume a dev-driven authoring model. Markdown, YAML, and CLI tools are fine for personal blogs or startups. But enterprise organizations need more. They need legal reviews, structured approvals, personalized content delivery, and preview links that don’t require standing up a preview server.

This is where Adobe EDS shines. Unlike other offerings, it isn’t cobbled together through third-party services or custom glue code. **It’s built to be complete.** Enterprise authoring, previewing, publishing, and personalization all in one. Not only does it bring edge-native performance, but it also meets legal and compliance needs without sacrificing speed.

To illustrate the differences, here’s how Adobe EDS stacks up against other popular options. Each platform is compared across the same five enterprise-relevant capabilities.

What you’ll find is not just differences in how these platforms operate, but in what they prioritize. Most developer-first tools treat authoring as an afterthought. They optimize for builds, not for business enablement. EDS flips that. It starts with authors, not code. It supports the preview cycle, not just the publish. And it supports teams beyond just marketing. Legal. Governance. Campaign managers. Everyone gets a seat at the table.

That’s what separates EDS. It’s not just edge delivery. It’s enterprise-ready architecture.

**Adobe EDS**

* **Authoring Surface:** Google Docs or Word
* **Preview Support:** Live with Universal Editor or preview aem.live
* **Personalization:** Manually able to integrate with AEP and Adobe Target
* **Enterprise Workflows:** Native review, approval, and legal compatibility with UE Sites
* **Edge Support:** First-class, deeply integrated

**Cloudflare Pages**

* **Authoring Surface:** Markdown
* **Preview Support:** Manual or CLI-based
* **Personalization:** Not natively supported
* **Enterprise Workflows:** Requires custom implementation
* **Edge Support:** Excellent, but developer-driven

**Netlify + Composable CMS (e.g., Sanity)**

* **Authoring Surface:** CMS UI + Markdown
* **Preview Support:** Possible with configuration
* **Personalization:** Varies based on CMS integration
* **Enterprise Workflows:** Partial. Often pieced together
* **Edge Support:** Strong, but fragmented

**Next.js SSG**

* **Authoring Surface:** Developer-built or headless CMS
* **Preview Support:** Available but requires effort
* **Personalization:** Possible with middleware or APIs
* **Enterprise Workflows:** Not native. Needs architecture
* **Edge Support:** Optimized with Next.js Edge Runtime

**Hugo**

* **Authoring Surface:** Markdown, Word with extensions
* **Preview Support:** Local preview with CLI
* **Personalization:** Not built-in
* **Enterprise Workflows:** Manual. I built jackconsults.com using Hugo and explored Word-to-Hugo pipelines [like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC9NZOcCdTI). The workflow exists but it’s fragile.
* **Edge Support:** Requires configuration. Not native

**Jekyll**

* **Authoring Surface:** Markdown
* **Preview Support:** Local only
* **Personalization:** Not supported
* **Enterprise Workflows:** Minimal
* **Edge Support:** Limited without custom CDN setup

EDS is not just different. It’s complete. From authoring to publishing, from compliance to performance. it’s the first enterprise-ready edge CMS.

# Where It Could Go

Adobe’s move with EDS is bold. Unlike the early days of CQ, there’s no crowd to stand out from. This is new territory. And Adobe is leading it.

EDS is more than just a shift in technology. It reshapes how teams think and operate. Business users continue to work in tools they already know and trust, like Word or Google Docs. Developers define templates and step aside, allowing authors to publish confidently and independently.

The backend doesn’t slow things down. There’s no complex infrastructure to debug or deploy. Pages render fast and reliably, right from the edge. The performance story isn't about optimization—it’s built into the model. What used to require coordination across engineering, marketing, and operations now happens in minutes, not weeks.

Frontend teams are still critical. They build the templates. They create the scaffolding. But once that’s done, business teams move independently. Review cycles are shortened. Campaigns move faster. And marketers can preview and publish without delay. **And there are no backend teams**.

This is the kind of architecture shift that doesn't just change platforms. It changes how teams work.
